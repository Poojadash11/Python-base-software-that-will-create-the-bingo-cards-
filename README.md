 Assignment Details
Task was to write a computer program in Python, which allows users to
 specify a number of cards to be created. Your program will create the requested
 cards, along with the numerical analysis of the simulations. The program should
 provide a comprehensive but easy to use and intuitive interface (text or graph
ical).
 1.1 Data Input
 In its most basic format, your program asks the user to provide the number of
 cards to create, and the number of simulations to run.
 1.2 Data Output
 Your program should create and display all the requested bingo cards (e.g. by
 using formatted printing to the screen), along with the requested analytics (by
 creating a matplotlib chart with the requested plot).
